ssh csce438@127.0.0.1 -p PORT GOES HERE


//To do
Remove SayHi Calls from client
Maybe added the router checks of the number of clients in client_db
Do more testing to make sure that the election works
    esp need to make sure that checkservers is functioning properly
        it may be return -1 on all calls even when a client is connected
    if I client disconnects and then reconnects with the same name it looked like it crashed
Add the client functionality for stress testing the servers
